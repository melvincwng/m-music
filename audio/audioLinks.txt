How to get music URLs (which is not as easy as getting image URLs):
A) Method 1: Open dev tools, some websites can find the audio src urls in the 'Elements' tab, but some cannot (those cannot use Method 2).
B) Method 2: Open dev tools, click on 'Play' song, inspect changes/logs in the 'Network' tab. Reasoning: 
When click Play, the webpage will send a request to server which usually returns the URL where the song is hosted at, and send back to client as a JSON response
This means we are able to see the returned URL (in form of JSON) from the "Network tab".
